# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a curated database of robotics faculty and researchers organized by academic rank (Full Professors, Associate Professors, Assistant Professors). The main content is in `robotic.md`, which provides detailed information about each researcher including:

- Institution affiliation
- Google Scholar citation counts (approximate)
- Personal/academic websites
- Key research areas with specific technical focus

## File Structure

- `robotic.md` - Main database of robotics faculty with comprehensive research area descriptions
- `README.md` - Simple repository identifier

## Content Guidelines

When working with the robotics faculty database:

- Maintain consistent table formatting with pipes (|) for markdown tables
- Keep citation counts as approximate values using the "â‰ˆ" symbol
- Research area descriptions should be technical and specific, focusing on methodological approaches rather than general topics
- Use consistent naming conventions for institutions (e.g., "University of California, Berkeley" vs "UC Berkeley")
- Preserve the academic hierarchy organization (Full/Associate/Assistant Professors)

## Research Area Categories

The database covers major robotics research domains including:
- Computer vision and perception
- Deep learning and reinforcement learning for robotics  
- Manipulation and grasping
- SLAM and navigation
- Human-robot interaction
- Swarm and multi-robot systems
- Bio-inspired robotics
- Tactile sensing and haptic feedback
- Motion planning and control
- Embodied AI and language grounding
